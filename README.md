# AI-enabled-b2b-Invoice-Management-application
A dashboard to manage Invoice and predict When Invoice is going to get Paid
## Machine Learning
Machine Learning, as an offshoot to Artificial Intelligence, is based around the idea that machines should be allowed to learn when exposed to data. This way machines learn from both structured and unstructured data, recognize patterns, and build business rules using algorithms that cannot be built by humans. Organizations now have to deal with complex business scenarios and judgment based decision making because of which they seek cognitive robots. Thus, machine learning can be really handy for organizations to simplify invoice processing that requires a lot of cognitive effort. As predicted, Machine Learning as market service would grow at a compound annual growth of 47%.
In this paper we are using basic machine learning algorithms to predict the aging bucket of a business. This aging bucket will tell us when payment is going to get paid. And now with AI into play, companies can now predict the metrics essential beforehand that saves a lot of time and effort which earlier was not possible with manual invoicing.
## JAVA Web Application
Payment and Transactions in the B2B or B2C scenario are a complex ordeal. It is very important to manage invoices on daily basis like adding new invoice of a business ,marked as paid ,delete a particular invoice or edit invoice etc. All this managing with manual invoicing is very tough. This will take lot of time and in this process and there is less visibility which can cause conflict between customer and business. In this paper we solved this problem with creating a JAVA web Application in which we used JDBC and Servlet Framework of JAVA programming language . We created Different servlets for the app like Add ,Delete, edit, Search, Advance search, Analytics View.We used React JS for the better UI and responsive Receivables Dashboard. Dashboard is the very important for this application because that is the only point of contact of the user and the application.We implemented lot of features in the UI also like predict button activation ,Grid data Loading and Sorting the data with respect to Columns. All this features help accounts department of a business to keep track of the invoices which they can manipulate according to their needs and there is a special feature of Analytics View which help accounts department to understand the trend of invoice settlement. All this features can boost the business which can lead a company to grow exponentially.
